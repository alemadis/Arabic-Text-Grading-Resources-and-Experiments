# Arabic-Text-Grading-Resources-and-Experiments

This repository was created and published for QCRI 2023 Summer Internship, under the project Arabic Text Grading: Resources and Experiments. The repository consists of folders and files that present the process, starting from gathering and collecting Arabic books from the Qatari ciriciulumn (Grades 1 - 12). We gathered books for the following subjects - Arabic, Social Studies, Computer Science, Geography, Islamic, Math, Qatar History, Science - from https://almanahj.com/qa/. Specifcally, the focus was on Arabic subject, in order to test and get the best OCR (Optical character recognition) package. Tesseract was the best OCR package for Arabic text, however, the generated text was further improved using Farasa librabry in order to fix words and spelling errors. The second data source was from Qatari Curriculum from MoE YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/@user-up3mh3xk7y/playlists - and data was gathered for Grades 1, 4, 6, 9 and 12. We built classification model for predicting Grades using two dataset sources, we trained the sentence by feature extarction (Sentence Characterstic and Readability Scores). We concluded that the OCR data had teh highest accuracy, however further word is needed as the OCR packages lacks the ability to exatrct text from Arabic books.
